# Fixing MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED Error

## Problem Description
The error `500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` with code `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` and ID `hkg1::kwmms-1760713493465-457972cf4476` occurs when there are issues in the Next.js middleware implementation, specifically with the Supabase SSR integration.

## Root Cause
The main issue was in the `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` file where:

1. The `NextResponse.next()` was being called multiple times in the cookie handlers, which is invalid in Next.js middleware
2. The request cookies were being modified incorrectly
3. Improper error handling that could cause the middleware to fail unexpectedly

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Cookie Handlers (Most Important Fix)
- Removed multiple calls to `NextResponse.next()` in cookie handlers
- Create the response object only once at the beginning
- Use `response.cookies.set()` and `response.cookies.set()` with `maxAge: 0` to remove cookies
- This was the primary cause of the `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` error

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added checks for environment variables before creating Supabase client
- Return a basic response without Supabase functionality if environment variables are missing
- Proper null handling for cases where environment variables are missing

### 3. Updated Import Path
- Fixed import path in `middleware.ts` from `'./lib/supabase/middleware'` to `'@/lib/supabase/middleware'` to use absolute imports

## Files Modified
- `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - Fixed the cookie handling and error management
- `middleware.ts` - Fixed import path
- Created `MIDDLEWARE_ERROR_FIX.md` - Documentation about the issue and fix

## What This Fixes
- Prevents the `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` error by not creating multiple response objects
- Properly manages Supabase session cookies in the middleware
- Ensures middleware doesn't crash when environment variables are missing
- Maintains proper Next.js middleware patterns and best practices

## Testing the Fix
After applying these changes:
1. The middleware should no longer throw the `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` error
2. Supabase authentication should work properly
3. The application should load without 500 errors
